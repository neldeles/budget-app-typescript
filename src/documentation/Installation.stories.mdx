# Installation and Setup

Below are the packages I used to build the app:
- [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [twin.macro with emotion](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/cra-emotion)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install)

I use `twin.macro` for styling my components. As the repo description succintly puts it,
"Twin blends the magic of Tailwind with the flexibility of css-in-js". And while Tailwind
now supports [just-in-time mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode)(which was the
primary reason I used twin), I still prefer to use Twin because of the abstractions it allows.

I use Storybook because [component-driven development](https://www.componentdriven.org) helps
me write more robust and concise code[^1].

[^1]: relative to how I used to my write code anyway lol
